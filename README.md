### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
My name is Julieta and I'm a self-taught IT student, currently learning ReactJS! 

Also with knowledge about HTML, CSS, Sass and Javascript.  

## Projects
I'm a languages enthusiast (and learning japanese at the moment), so I enjoy facing my projects towards language learning.  

You can see my two japanese oriented apps deployed at:

**Hiragana Flashcards**: https://hiragana-flashcards-seven.vercel.app/ (ReactJS)

**Colors Flashcards**: https://japanesecolors.vercel.app/ (Vanilla JavaScript)

And my first ReactJS project:

**To-Do List**: https://todolist-react-nine.vercel.app/  
  
Hope you find this interesting!
