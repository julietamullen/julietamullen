### Welcome!
Hello there! My name is Julieta and I'm a self-taught IT student, currently learning ReactJS! 

I'm a languages enthusiast (learning japanese at the moment), so I enjoy facing my projects towards language learning.  

You can see my most recent projects deployed at:

https://hiragana-flashcards-seven.vercel.app/ (ReactJS)

https://japanesecolors.vercel.app/ (Vanilla JavaScript)

https://todolist-react-nine.vercel.app/  (ReactJS)

https://rockpaperscissors-theta.vercel.app/ (ReactJS)
  
Hope you find this interesting!
